# How to contribute
If you're interested, contributors are welcome!

As a frontend developer, I looked for a solution like this many times, but anything worked really well. So I decided to write my JS function.
You can use this library and help make this better!

## What ellipsed needs
* Passion, love and optimization. It is at the first development stage: it works. It works well but it needs optimization.
* Perhaps a better README or documentation. 
  
If you can help in any way - coding, writing documentation or correcting my basic English - create a branch and a pull request!

## Getting started
I usually use yarn. You can install `serve` with ```yarn install``` and try the example web page by typing: ```yarn start```.
For testing or development, you can use that example page.

In the `src` folder you can find the source code, which is written in ES6 and compiled with babel. To build it, run `yarn build`, alternatively you can run `yarn watch` to keep babel running and automatically compiling your changes to the source code.
