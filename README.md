## What is Ellipsed?
Ellipsed is a JavaScript library for generating multi-lined ellipsed text.  
Indicating the number of visible lines, it will truncate the text at the correct position in targeted elements.

## Demo  
You can see the demo here: https://nzambello.github.io/ellipsed/

The [example/](https://github.com/nzambello/ellipsed/tree/master/example) directory of this repo contains the demo showed above.
To start it on your local machine, clone the repository and install it by following the installation instructions below, then start it with `npm start` (or with `yarn start`).  

## Install
```sh
# Yarn
yarn add ellipsed

# NPM
npm install --save ellipsed

# Bower
bower install ellipsed
```

## Usage
Call the ellipsis method with three parameters:
````javascript
ellipsis(selector, rows, options);
````

- `selector` - A CSS selector string used to target the element for truncation
- `rows` - An integer value used as the number of rows that should be visible, following words will be trucated with the `replaceStr` (default is `'...'`).
- `options` - Allows an options object to be passed to further customise the functionality. See options section below for details.
  
If `responsive` option is set, the function returns the ID of the listener returned by `setTimeout`. It can be useful to clear resize handler timeout.

### Options
Options can be passed through the method using the third parameter, which provides greater control.

Name | Type |  Default | Description
---- | ---- |  ------- | -----------
replaceStr | string | `'...'` | The string that substituted following the trucated string.
responsive | boolean | `false` | If true, the method is re-called on resize event, so the number of rows is preserved.
debounceDelay | integer | `250` | If `responsive` option is set, it's the delay value for resizing events debouncing.
delimiter | string | `' '` | Use '' for text written in languages such as Japanese, Chinese, etc. since there's usually no space break in such languages; or for text contains long word (word that is longer than the width of the container).

### Import
Ellipsed is provided as a UMD module.

You can use it as a ES6 module:
```javascript
import { ellipsis } from 'ellipsed';
```
As a CommonJS module:
```javascript
var { ellipsis } = require('ellipsed');
```
As an AMD module:
```javascript
require([
  'ellipsed'
], function(ellipsed) {
  var ellipsis = ellipsed.ellipsis;
});
```
Or as a global module in the browser:
```javascript
var ellipsis = window.ellipsed.ellipsis;
```

## Performance

It seems that having multiple calls of ellipsis with `responsive`Â option enabled would add multiple event listeners and would be recommended to use a single call with a multiple selector.
A single event listener should be more efficient and events handling more fluid.


## Browser support
The library has been tested on:

- Google Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 10+
- Edge 14+
- IE 9+
